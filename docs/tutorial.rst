Tutorial
========

There are two different options provided here.

You may either follow along with a tutorial that demonstrates usage of an api
powered by flask-praetorian by issuing commands via the curl command line tool.

Alternatively, there is a web-powered user interface that has been custom built
to demonstrate consuming an api powered by flask-praetorian

Either will provide a nice introduction to the features and methods for using
flask-praetorian.
